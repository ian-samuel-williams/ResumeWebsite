        >Music is an extremely important and prevalent part of one&rsquo;s life.
        According to the Nielsen Music 360 Report, in 2019, the average United
        States consumer spent 26.9 hours listening to music per week
        (Department). This translates to over 3.8 hours of music listened to per
        day by the average consumer. This is a large amount of space every day
        dedicated to a hobby which, excluding instrumental genres such as
        classical music and EDM, essentially involves someone speaking to us.
        The words this person says varies; some people prefer to listen to
        positive music with uplifting lyrics, some prefer catchy songs with
        meaningless lyrics, some prefer songs with more depressing tones and
        sadder lyrics. Regardless of what message one prefers, the lyrics still
        are being heard and absorbed into the brain, and one might be interested
        in figuring out how positive or negative these lyrics are.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >The classic saying &ldquo;you are what you eat&rdquo; essentially means
        that your personal health can be quite easily controlled, to an extent,
        by what foods you decide to eat. It&rsquo;s often told to kids who are
        quick to exchange healthier foods for foods higher in sugar content and
        fat in their diet. I believe however that another similar expression can
        be made: you are what you listen to. Because we take in these lyrics
        that we listen to, one could argue that it would be good to take an
        evaluation of the emotions portrayed and expressed in the songs one
        spends large amounts of time listening to.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >I decided to take a deeper look into the music I listen to, with the
        goal of viewing how positive or negative the emotions expressed in my
        most-listened to songs are. Music has had a large influence in my life,
        with my parents even warning me at an earlier age that negative music
        would lead me down a darker path. I decided to attempt to figure out
        exactly how negative the music I listened to was, from a completely
        unbiased perspective. Studying this is important for several reasons.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >For one, music has taken a darker tone recently. The emotions of
        &ldquo;anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and conscientiousness have
        increased significantly, while joy, confidence, and openness expressed
        in pop song lyrics have declined&rdquo; (Napier). I would consider
        myself to be a fairly average music-listener, and thus it would be
        interesting to see whether the music I listen to really reflects that
        cultural shift; whether there is truly more negative than
        positive.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >Another reason this study is important is because the emotions that
        music expresses is a very &ldquo;basic feature of Western music&rdquo;
        (Fritz). In order to truly understand the music one listens to, one has
        to understand the basic components of it, and emotion just happens to be
        one of those components. Perhaps through this study I could find a
        greater understanding and appreciation of the music that I already
        listen to. Or perhaps I could gain new insight provided on how the
        language used leans more positively or negatively.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >The final and most important reason why I would like to dive deeper
        into the emotions portrayed in my music is backed by scientific
        research. Music can be viewed as an art form; a form of expressing
        emotions, but music can also be viewed as a tool for managing emotions.
        Music has been found to regulate emotions among adolescents, both males
        and females (Alan Wells). There is a potential problem with this,
        however.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >If an individual is finding that only negative music will give them any
        sort of joy, this can cause them to rely heavily on songs with lyrics
        that may put them in a worse mental position. It has been discovered
        that activation of any nodes in the brain, apart from those in the
        displeasure center, will cause the individual to sense pleasure
        (Schubert). Listeners experiencing a difficult season in life might
        become attracted to darker and more negative music, and since they can
        still sense pleasure from it, they might eventually replace all of their
        music with more negative tracks. This is a problem not only because this
        means there are less positive influences in the individual&#39;s life,
        but also because negative music has been shown to possibly worsen
        one&rsquo;s mood (Stewart). This could perhaps create a downward spiral,
        where the individual&rsquo;s mood worsens because of life and it&rsquo;s
        challenges, and then the individual turns to negative music for a sense
        of comfort. This negative music, however, points the individual in a
        darker direction and then worsens the individual&#39;s mood, resulting
        in them relying on this music, which in turn worsens their mood further.
        If I find out that there&rsquo;s more negativity expressed than
        positivity in the songs I listen to, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to make a
        change. Possibly introducing new, positive music would help.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >This project is one that would not per say reveal important information
        to others, and wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily show others how to live their
        lives. This is one that is reflective for me, that shows me how my music
        listening habits might have to change. The main tool I&rsquo;m using for
        this project, VADER sentiment analysis, views things purely from an
        objective perspective. Instead of interpreting sentences in their full
        context, which would be a more human way of sentiment analysis, the tool
        analyzes the individual words in a sentence, determining whether the
        words lean in a more positive or negative direction. Therefore this is a
        process that is purely objective, and reveals a very different side of
        sentiment analysis that could not be done easily or quickly without the
        use of programming.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >If one were to perform sentiment analysis on these songs manually, one
        might skip over and fail to understand the meaning of negativity. While
        a phrase such as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m killing it&rdquo; might sound positive
        to us as humans, the software would interpret this as negative, as this
        uses the word &ldquo;kill&rdquo;. Because of this individual word-based
        approach, we get deeper insight into the pure negativity and positivity,
        regardless of context or overall meaning. This is advantageous, as it
        might be possible that negative words in a positive sentence could still
        affect us negatively.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >Of course this could also be a disadvantage to the strength of these
        results as context is very important. The reflection of negativity in
        this study is accurate based on how the listener listens to a song. If
        the listener listens passively, hearing the words but not understanding
        the meaning, the measures of negativity and positivity applies. If the
        listener actively listens and tries to understand the meaning, the
        measures of positivity and negativity do not apply as much. That being
        said, whatever style the listener would listen in, the measures still
        apply to an extent.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >For this project I decided to take data from Apple and their privacy
        section from Apple&rsquo;s website. I chose this data source not only
        because it was extensive, but also because Apple has a habit of setting
        the industry standards for accuracy and consistency. As the data I
        wanted to collect would be statistics on my Apple Music account, the
        most reliable source would logically be the provider of the service
        themselves, Apple. The other main reason I decided to collect this data
        from Apple was because they are the exclusive provider of said data,
        thanks to their extremely rigid policies on user privacy.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >This data was collected from the 16th of August 2020, the date I
        subscribed to Apple Music, to the 4th of February 2021, the date I
        requested my data from Apple. The data is extremely extensive, covering
        not only the exact time the song was started and ended, but also the
        reason the song was ended, where the song was played from, the track
        name and artist, and many others which altogether totalled 30 different
        variables. The most important variable for this study that was recorded
        is the play duration of the song in milliseconds, which displayed how
        long the song was played for. There were no missing cases, which is
        impressive for a dataset with over </span
      ><span
        >35621 different observations. The data was generated as I selected
        songs to be played, which allowed the data to be highly accurate.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >The first step to conducting analyses on this dataset was to look
        through the data. Understanding which variables needed to be focused on
        and manipulated was confusing, as there are two very similar variables:
        play duration in milliseconds, and media duration in milliseconds. The
        former is a measure of how long I played the content for during that
        instance of playing the song, and the latter is how long the song
        actually is. &nbsp;</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >I imported pandas, matplotlib, and matplotlib pyplot for the data. I
        also had to install VADER sentiment analyzer through pip, and then
        imported the sentiment intensity analyzer through VADER sentiment
        analyzer.

        decided to go by the compound VADER sentiment intensity analyzer score
        of each of the lines to determine what sort of emotion they expressed.
        This compound score is a score between -1 and 1 which summarizes how
        positive or negative the sentence analyzed is, the lower scores being
        negative, the higher scores being positive, and the scores near zero
        being neutral. I decided to use the same threshold as the github page
        for the tool (</span

        positive if the compound score was greater than or equal to 0.05,
        negative if the compound score was lesser than or equal to -0.05, and
        neutral otherwise. This also means that entire sentences were either
        counted as neutral, negative, or positive, so even though certain
        sentences could contain both positive and negative sentiments, whichever
        was the greatest level of emotion was the one that the sentence was

    <p>
      <span
        >The results for some songs were anticipated. I expected the songs by
        the late Pop Smoke, an artist who was known for creating drill rap (a
        type of rap which is focused on appearing intimidating and threatening),
        to rank more negatively, and in fact Welcome to the Party was the most
        negative out of the top five songs. Over 45 percent of the 59 lines
        leaned negatively, which is not surprising given the highly explicit
        language used and the general subject matter. Given that Pop Smoke was
        part of a gang, hearing that he shoots &ldquo;one in the head&rdquo;
        with &ldquo;ten in the clip&rdquo; is not something that is immediately
        shocking to hear from him, but one can also get lost in his extremely
        gruff voice which can sometimes distract from the extreme subject
        matter. I wasn&rsquo;t even sure of what the lyrics were until they were
        laid out in front of me, and once I saw them it was easy to see that
        this song would be seen by the sentiment analysis tool as very
        negative.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >The other song by Pop Smoke which cracked my top 5 most played songs,
        Hello, while not nearly as aggressive as Welcome to the Party, still
        displayed themes of objectification and references murder on multiple
        occasions. Once again, I suspected that this would have high negative
        scores, which it did (as around 34% of the lines were negative).
        &nbsp;The other results were more interesting and unexpected,
        however.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >The song with the highest percentage of positive lines was Soul Food II
        by Logic. Given that Logic&rsquo;s motto is &ldquo;peace, love, and
        positivity&rdquo;, this wasn&rsquo;t too much of a shock but the real
        shock &nbsp;was that it was only really positive in comparison to the
        other songs I studied. Compared to other songs outside of my top 5, or
        in comparison to other music, this would be considered a fairly negative
        song. For Logic being an artist that prides himself on his friendly and
        fairly positive outlook on life, there was still a higher percentage of
        negative lines than positive lines in Soul Food II, and while the
        difference was only around 2 percent, this still strikes me as somewhat
        strange. Granted, Soul Food II is not necessarily one of Logic&rsquo;s
        most positive and encouraging songs, but it&rsquo;s also not one that I
        would initially say is more negative than positive. The latter half of
        the lyrics is entirely dedicated to storytelling, and the first half is
        Logic dealing with his thoughts as he&rsquo;s realizing his success as a
        rapper.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >One would think that Soul Food II would score significantly higher
        positive scores than Lemonade, a song entirely dedicated to prescription
        cough syrup and bragging, but the scores are very similar for both. This
        was somewhat strange as well, that a song which has far less
        encouragement and inspirational lines had a very similar percentage of
        positive lines to Logic&rsquo;s song.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >Fast Lane is the outlier here, with more negative lines than positive,
        but more than 53% of the lines were neutral. One of the two rappers in
        Bad Meets Evil, the artists of the song, is Eminem who is notorious for
        including negative connotations within his lyrics, but this is not the
        most negative out of the five songs. Nor is it the most positive, this
        is simply the song with the most neutral lines.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >This reveals that I essentially couldn&rsquo;t accurately predict the
        scores of three out of the five songs. This is interesting for several
        reasons.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >One of the reasons that I wasn&rsquo;t able to predict the emotions of
        the music I listened to could be that my usage of the VADER Sentiment
        Analysis tool has its flaws. The system for collecting scores on songs
        was flawed, but also somewhat difficult to improve. This is because
        instead of the songs being analyzed for how negative the lines are,
        they&rsquo;re simply being analyzed as to whether the line is more on
        the positive or negative side, given that I used the compound score.
        This means that an extremely negative line will have the same impact as
        a line that&rsquo;s slightly negative. So a line like &ldquo;even when
        I&rsquo;m winning, feel like I&rsquo;m losing&rdquo; on Soul Food II
        would be treated as equally negative as &ldquo;I catch a body, next day
        I forget it&rdquo; from Welcome to the Party. Because of this, I
        misjudged just how negatively a song like Soul Food II could be
        interpreted.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >Secondly, it shows that I as a listener don&rsquo;t truly comprehend
        how positive or negative the music I listen to is. The purpose of this
        study was to see what emotions were expressed in the songs I listen to
        most. I wondered whether I would be able to accurately guess whether the
        songs I listen to would be positive or negative, but unfortunately I
        wasn&rsquo;t able to do that. I can&rsquo;t accurately predict from an
        objective standpoint whether the music I listen to is positive or
        negative. This truly shows an advantage that technology could have over
        the individual.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >This study mainly revealed to me that I can&rsquo;t make accurate
        judgements on the emotions expressed in my music, and that the music I
        listen to is significantly more negative than I would&rsquo;ve expected.
        Rap music tends to get a bad reputation, but according to this study,
        the bad reputation is somewhat deserved. &nbsp;It was interesting to see
        what the emotions expressed were of the songs I studied, but it also led
        me to the realization that it&rsquo;s something I might want to pay more
        attention to. I might need to consider changing my listening habits to
        an extent in order to protect myself from extreme negative
        influences.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >This study also revealed to me that computers can&rsquo;t solve and
        interpret everything. We as humans have created such complex languages
        that can&rsquo;t be nearly as accurately interpreted and understood.
        There are flaws with the VADER sentiment analysis tool, and the way I
        used it was not nearly perfect. Changing the way I used it, however,
        would only solve half of the problem, and the root problem is the idea
        of using a computer to interpret language, especially lyrics. Lyrics
        aren&rsquo;t meant to be read, they&rsquo;re meant to be heard, and the
        only way they can truly be interpreted and understood is through
        listening to them the way the artist intended.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span
        >In conclusion, while I learned a lot from this study about the emotions
        expressed in the music I listen to, I also learned more unexpected
        things. I learned that the music I listen to is likely too negative, and
        that I should put more effort into listening to more positive songs. I
        also learned that the emotions expressed in the music I listen to
        reflects the more negative shift of the culture as a whole. Finally, I
        learned that emotions are difficult to be processed by a computer, which
        poses several questions to those in the artificial intelligence field.
        This study could never be made perfect, but it provided some insight
        regardless, and is something I could continue to improve in the
        future.</span
